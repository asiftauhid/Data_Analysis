This repository contains a selection of my past projects focused on data handling and analysis.

Here are the projects and a brief description about them:  
1) __Movie Correlation Project__
   Description: This project entailed a comprehensive analysis of a dataset comprising 7,669 movies, each characterized by various              attributes including the name of the production company, release year, budget, ratings, number of votes, and gross earnings. The primary     objective was to identify the attribute that exhibits the strongest correlation with the movies' gross earnings and to ascertain the         factors that most significantly influence the financial success of films.

3) __Hotel Finding Project__   
   Description: This program is designed to efficiently manage and navigate a comprehensive dataset of hotels, encompassing a variety of        attributes such as name, star rating, location, among others. It facilitates the organization and retrieval of hotel information based       on these diverse features, thereby streamlining the process of hotel management and discovery.
