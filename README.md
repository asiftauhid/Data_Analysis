This repository contains a selection of my past projects focused on data handling and analysis.

Here are the projects and a brief description about them:  
1) __Movie Correlation Project__  
   Description: This project entailed a comprehensive analysis of a dataset comprising 7,669 movies, each characterized by various              attributes including the name of the production company, release year, budget, ratings, number of votes, and gross earnings. The primary     objective was to identify the attribute that exhibits the strongest correlation with the movies' gross earnings and to ascertain the         factors that most significantly influence the financial success of films.

3) __Hotel Finding Project__   
   Description: This program is designed to efficiently manage and navigate a comprehensive dataset of hotels, encompassing a variety of        attributes such as name, star rating, location, among others. It facilitates the organization and retrieval of hotel information based       on these diverse features, thereby streamlining the process of hotel management and discovery.

4) __Movie Data Analysis Replication__   
   Description: This project is a combination of some in depth real life data analysis done as a group for a graduate level course I took at    NYU, to replicate some part of the research paper ([click here to view](https://blog.pascallisch.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/proj110107.pdf)) written by the professor Pascal Wallisch and his cowriter Jake Alden    Whritner.

3) __RateMyProfessor Data Analysis__   
   Description: This project analyzes RateMyProfessor data to explore various aspects of professor ratings, including gender bias, tag correlations, and prediction models for key attributes like average ratings, difficulty, and "Pepper" awards. The analysis incorporates advanced statistical methods and machine learning models to derive meaningful insights.
