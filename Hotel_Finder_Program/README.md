**How to run the project**  
Use terminal or similar command line interface to run the makefile which is written in c++ and use the hotels.csv file as your dataset. There are six main commands that can be performed in this Hotel Finder program to help smoothen the experience of managing the hotel dataset. They are-  
   
1) insert <Hotel Details 
2) find <HotelName,CityName>   
3) findAll < CityName >  
4) findAll <CityName,Stars>  
5) delete <HotelName,CityName>
