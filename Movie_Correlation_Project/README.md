__Movie Correlation Project__  
**Project Overview**  
This project delves into a dataset comprising 7,669 movies, focusing on various attributes such as company names, release years, budgets, ratings, votes, and gross earnings. The primary objective is to uncover which attributes exhibit the most significant correlation with the movies' gross earnings and to determine the factors that most influence a movie's financial success.  
  
**Key Objectives**  
To analyze the dataset to identify correlations between movie attributes and gross earnings.  
To investigate which factors contribute most to a movie's box office success.  
To utilize statistical analysis and visualization techniques to present findings.
  
**Dataset**  
The dataset includes 7,669 movies with attributes including:  
Name  
Rating  
Genre  
Year  
Released Date  
Score  
Votes  
Director  
Writer  
Star  
Country  
Budget

**Tools and Technologies Used**  
Jupyter Notebook: For conducting the analysis and visualization.   
Python Libraries: pandas for data manipulation and analysis.  
                  matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
                  numpy for numerical calculations.
Statistical Methods: Correlation analysis using Pearson's coefficient.

**Analysis Process**  
Data Cleaning: Processing the dataset to handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to understand distributions, variances, and patterns.  
Correlation Analysis: Employing Pearson's correlation coefficient to determine the relationships between various movie attributes and their gross earnings.  
Visualization: Creating plots and charts to visually represent the analysis findings and correlations.  

**Key Findings**  
Even though the initially prediction was that Company has higher impact on the gross earning of a specific movie. But the finding suggests that budget has the leading impact on the gross earnings of different movies. Where votes has the second most correlation.    

**How to Run the Project**  
Set up python environment, install dependencies, and run the Jupyter notebook for those who wish to explore the analysis themselves.
